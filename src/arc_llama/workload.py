"""Workload profile: what the declared usage answers change for tuning.

The tuner measured at 1024 prompt / 128 gen and concluded f16 KV beats q8_0 —
true at that measurement point and wrong for a model actually used at 131k
context, where f16 KV does not fit in 24 GB at all. The answers gathered by
`arc-llama init` (persisted in the [workload] config section) exist so the
tuner optimises the workload rather than the benchmark:

  * context_length sets the tuning context target and prunes KV candidates
    that cannot hold it in VRAM,
  * style maps agentic -> prompt target, conversational -> generation,
  * priority weights the score between prompt-eval and generation.

Every field may be empty ("not sure"); an empty profile reproduces the
pre-profile behaviour exactly.
